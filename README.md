# gre-vocalulary-dictionary
A tool for helping me memorize common GRE words and other common vocabulary.

# Well, this project is useless. When I was working on it, I wasn't aware of vocabulary.com, which is way better than what this project could become: after all, you can give a list of words that you want to learn, and it will teach you those words by giving you exercises with those words in context, which is way better than simply having a list of words in dictionary format.
